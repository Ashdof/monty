# Monty Project

## The Monty language
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

# General Objectives
At the end of the lesson, we were able to:
- State the meaning of LIFO and FIFO
- Define a stack, and state when to use it
- Describe a queue, and explain when to use it
- State the common implementations of stacks and queues
- Identify the most common use cases of stacks and queues
- Recognise the proper way to use global variables
